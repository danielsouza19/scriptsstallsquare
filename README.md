# Script Stall Square
This repository contains all files we use to update stall square scripts.

The projects we have here so far are:

• heat_map: hexagons heatmaps, that calculates the device density per hexagon, going from orange (low density) to dark red (high density)
• trade_areas: automating the PTA, STA and TTA trade areas by using k-means clustering on the distance combined with number of visits for each location
• pathing: where were the customers 30 min before going to the store?
• visitors baseline: historical visits and number of visitors over time
